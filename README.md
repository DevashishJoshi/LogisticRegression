# LogisticRegression
Alpha (learning rate)               : 1
Epoch (num_iters)                   : 10,000
Accuracy (as predicted on test set) : 97.77

Description:
The folder contains 5 main .py files.

1. LogisticReg.py
2. costAndGrad
3. gradientDesc
4. sigmoid
5. calcAccuracy

The graph of cost(J) vs number of iterations is plotted while descending.
